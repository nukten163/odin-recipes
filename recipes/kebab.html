    <h2>Indian-Style Seekh Kebab</h2>
    <p>These lamb seekh kebabs are a spicy and extremely flavorful recipe that will surely be a hit at any outdoor party.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds lean ground lamb</li>
        <li>

2 medium onions, finely chopped
</li>
        <li>

½ cup fresh mint leaves, finely chopped
</li>
        <li>

½ cup cilantro, finely chopped
</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li> Mix ground lamb, onions, mint, cilantro, ginger paste, and chile paste together in a large bowl. Season with cumin, coriander, paprika, salt, and cayenne. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Soak skewers in cold water. </li>
        <li> Divide lamb mixture into 8 equal portions; mold portions onto skewers to form a sausage shape. Refrigerate skewers until you are ready to grill. </li>
        <li> Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and brush the grate liberally with oil. </li>
        <li> Cook skewers on the preheated grill, turning frequently, until nicely browned on all sides and meat is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). </li>
    </ol>
